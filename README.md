xbmc-minimal
===================

* Install Ubuntu minimal 12.04LTS on your HTPC machine...

i386: http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/precise/main/installer-i386/current/images/netboot/mini.iso

x64: http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/precise/main/installer-amd64/current/images/netboot/mini.iso

* Make sure you installed your Ubuntu minimal with xbmc user creating after running script is a BAD idea.

* ...and run the following on the machine afterwards to install and configure XBMC (NVIDIA supported, and some Intel video cards probably wont work, ATI is now not supported (see below)

```
cd ~ 
wget https://github.com/uNiversaI/xbmc-ubuntu-minimal/blob/master/12.04/xbmcinstall.sh
bash ./xbmcinstall.sh
```

####Note

* ATI Video cards Not supported anymore atm since XVBA has been abandoned and not developed anymore.
Instead this is used now [Linux Radeon OSS with vdpau how-to](http://forum.xbmc.org/showthread.php?tid=174854 "Linux Radeon OSS with vdpau how-to")

* On INTEL systems it is recommended to upgrade to kernel 3.11rc1 (inclusive firmware update) It probably wont work anymore for some intel stuff anyway.
[Linux vaapi-sse4: Deinterlacing Testing] (http://forum.xbmc.org/showthread.php?tid=165707 "Linux vaapi-sse4: Deinterlacing Testing")

Both of that needs adding to script for options for each ATI and Intel without breaking nvidia.
